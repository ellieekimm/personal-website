            <h1>Hi, I'm Ellie Kim.</h1>
            <h2>I'm a rising sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill studying Computer Science! I have experience in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and data analaytics.  More importantly, I've discovered that my drive extends beyond technical skills; I am deeply committed to leveraging technology for social good and advocating for accessibility and inclusivity in every tech product I work on. I truly believe technology has the power to break barriers and create a more inclusive world.</h2>

                <h3>SAS Product Experience Intern</h3>
                <p>May - August 2023</p>
                <p class = "descrip">During my internship, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of website design and development, where I actively engaged in every aspect of the UX research process. A defining feature of this internship was the incorporation of AI technologies, such as MidJourney, ChatGPT, and Looka, which allowed me to explore their impact on the design and development process. I diligently analyzed the benefits and detriments that AI brings to the table. This highly relevant experience not only expanded my technical skill set but also deepened my understanding of how AI can revolutionize the website development landscape in the pursuit of user-centric solutions.</p>
