            <h1>Hi, I'm Ellie Kim.</h1>
            <h2>I'm a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill studying Computer Science! I have experience in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and data analytics. Furthermore, I love creating tech products that advocate for accessibility and inclusivity along with being creative and fun! I strongly believe in tech's intersection with other fields, such as journalism, healthcare, and more, to create solutions that truly impact as many people as possible. </h2>

                <h3>SAS Product Experience Intern</h3>
                <p id = "lang">May - August 2023</p>
                <p class = "descrip">During my internship, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of design and development, where I actively engaged in every aspect of the UX research process. A defining question of this internship was: </p>
                <h2 id = "internquestion"><strong>What role do AI technologies play in website design and development? Additionally, what advantages and potential risks come with their implementation?</strong> </h2>
                <p>This research question, focused on ChatGPT and MidJourney, was used to propose solutions to SAS designers in ways they can best optimize these AI tools, through, for example, suggestions of prompt phrases and keywords. A main concern that was brought up through this internship was the inevitable biases of generative AI tools and the impact they make in the UX research process. This highly relevant experience not only expanded my technical skill set but also deepened my understanding of how AI can revolutionize the design and development landscape in the constant pursuit of accessible and inclusive user-centric solutions.</p>
