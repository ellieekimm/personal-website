            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <h3>Figma</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by a friend with dyslexia who often struggled with the lack of inclusive resources within computer science. Hello World delivers an experience that is optimized for dyslexic users learning to code. We meticulously researched the best practices for UI/UX design for individuals with dyslexia and incorporated these principles into every aspect of the app, from the color scheme and font choice to the way information is presented, with the use of underlining, high contrast colors, and clear text blocks. Awarded Highest STEM-Interest Inclusivity Hack by Qorvo.

                <h1>Korean Name Generator</h1>
                <h3>Node.js, EJS, Express.js, HTML, CSS</h3>
                <p>Being of Korean-American descent, my Korean name "Chaewon" has consistently been a cherished connection to my heritage and cultural roots. This motivated me to develop this application, aiming to inspire people from all backgrounds to embrace Korean names and delve into the richness of their meanings and significance!
                    <br><br>For this webpage, I configure an Express server to serve static files and handle routes for generating, saving, and pronouncing Korean names, utilizing the "korean-name-generator" package and "say" package for text-to-speech functionality. Users are able to save names and view them in a separate webpage, along with adding their own favorite Korean names, increasing user engagement. </p>
